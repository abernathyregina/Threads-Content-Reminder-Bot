# Threads Content Reminder Bot

A lightweight automation system that reminds creators and teams when it’s time to post on Threads, nudges them with context-aware prompts, and can auto-open the Threads app to draft or schedule posts. It removes the messy spreadsheets and manual alarms by orchestrating reminders across devices, accounts, and time zones. The outcome: consistent posting cadence, higher engagement, and fewer missed content windows — all powered by a resilient Android automation backbone.

## Introduction
**What it does**  
This bot manages content reminders for Meta Threads: it schedules prompts, opens Threads at the right moment, pre-fills captions from your queue, and logs posting outcomes.

**Problem it automates**  
Creators and teams often miss ideal posting windows. Manual reminders don’t scale across multiple brands, time zones, or device farms. This automation centralizes schedules and drives on-device reminders with human-like navigation.

**Benefit**  
Reliable posting rhythm, fewer missed posts, and measurable lift in engagement via consistent execution and data-backed timing.

### Automating Threads Posting Cadence
- Uses device-level signals to trigger reminders and optionally open Threads with the correct account/profile active.  
- Pulls upcoming content from a queue and injects captions/hashtags into the compose flow (where supported).  
- Rotates proxies and devices to run reminders at scale without account collisions.  
- Logs delivered reminders, snoozes, dismissals, and posting confirmations for analytics and iteration.

## Core Features
- **Real Devices and Emulators:** Run on physical Android phones or emulators (Bluestacks/Nox) with identical workflows and audit-ready logs.  
- **No-ADB Wireless Automation:** Control devices over Wi-Fi via Appilot’s agent for stable, cable-free operations — ideal for racks and device farms.  
- **Mimicking Human Behavior:** Randomized delays, natural scroll/tap paths, soft-press timings, and view-based decisioning to avoid robotic patterns.  
- **Multiple Accounts Support:** Maintain isolated session profiles; auto-switch to the right Threads account before sending a reminder or opening compose.  
- **Multi-Device Integration:** Orchestrate reminders across 1–1000 devices with queue-based dispatching and per-device work rates.  
- **Exponential Growth for Your Account:** Keeps posting cadence steady, compounding reach via consistent timing and “never miss” reminder logic.  
- **Premium Support:** Priority help, SLA-backed incident response, and guided onboarding for complex setups.  
- **Role-Based Schedules:** Per brand/role calendars (Creator, Editor, Approver) with guardrails and approvals.  
- **Quiet Hours & Smart Snooze:** Respect sleep/region windows; adjustable snooze with backoff to re-prompt at better times.  
- **Analytics & Timing Optimization:** Tracks open/post actions, CTR to compose, and best-time windows; auto-suggests schedule tweaks.

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| Content Queue Injection | Pulls caption/assets from a secure queue and pre-fills compose (where UI permits), reducing tap friction. |
| Account Context Guardrails | Verifies the active account/profile before reminders and auto-corrects if mismatched. |
| Geo/Timezone Awareness | Converts schedules to device-local time; DST-safe with per-profile overrides. |
| Proxy & Network Profiles | Per-device proxy rotation and health checks to stabilize sessions in large farms. |
| Audit Logs & Webhooks | Emits structured events (delivered/snoozed/posted) to your data lake or Slack/Discord. |
| Failure Auto-Recovery | Detects stalled screens, reboots the app/device if needed, and resumes the flow gracefully. |

## How It Works
1. **Input or Trigger** — From the Appilot dashboard, select the Threads schedules, accounts, and content queues. Optionally enable auto-open compose and quiet hours.  
2. **Core Logic** — Appilot coordinates devices via UI Automator/Appium or wireless agent controls: wakes device, validates account, opens Threads, and (optionally) injects caption text.  
3. **Output or Action** — Users receive an on-device reminder or the compose screen ready-to-post; events are logged and sent to dashboards or messaging hooks.  
4. **Other functionalities** — Retries, exponential backoff snoozes, structured logging, parallel device workers, and alerting for missed SLAs are configurable in the dashboard.

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** Kotlin, Java, JavaScript, Python  
- **Frameworks:** Appium, UI Automator, Espresso, Robot Framework, Cucumber  
- **Tools:** Appilot, Android Debug Bridge (ADB), Appium Inspector, Bluestacks, Nox Player, Scrcpy, Firebase Test Lab, Accessibility  
- **Infrastructure:** Dockerized device farms, Cloud-based emulators, Proxy networks, Parallel Device Execution, Task Queues, Real device farm

## Use Cases
- **Solo creators** use it to get timely, device-level reminders and one-tap compose, so they maintain a consistent posting habit.  
- **Agencies** use it to coordinate multi-brand calendars across hundreds of devices, so they avoid collisions and missed windows.  
- **Social teams** use it to enforce quiet hours and approval flows, so posts go live at the right time with the right account.  
- **Growth marketers** use it to experiment with posting times, so they can lift engagement via data-backed timing suggestions.

## FAQs
**How do I configure this automation for multiple accounts?**  
Define profiles in `devices.yaml` and `account_store.py`. Each run associates a device with a profile and target schedule to ensure the correct Threads account opens before any reminder or compose action.

**Does it support proxy rotation or anti-detection?**  
Yes. Configure per-device proxies in `proxies.yaml`. The runtime validates egress, rotates when unhealthy, and tags logs with proxy IDs to trace anomalies.

**Can I schedule it to run periodically?**  
Absolutely. The scheduler supports cron-like rules and queue-based triggers. You can also enable smart snooze with exponential backoff for missed windows.

**What happens if Threads UI changes?**  
Selectors are abstracted in `threads_flows.py`. Update a single map (resource IDs, content-descriptions) and ship. Fallbacks attempt text/vision matches to stay resilient.

**Can it just remind, without opening the app?**  
Yes. You can choose “reminder-only” mode to deliver notifications/toasts and Slack/Discord pings without UI navigation.

## Performance & Reliability Benchmarks
- **Execution Speed:** Reminder delivery under 2–4 seconds per device in steady state; compose open typically <10 seconds depending on device class.  
- **Success Rate:** 95% successful reminder delivery across mixed device farms in internal tests.  
- **Scalability:** Horizontally scales from a single handset to **300–1000** devices with queue workers and per-device rate limits.  
- **Resource Efficiency:** Lightweight workers (<150MB RSS each) with batched I/O and reusable sessions to reduce CPU wakeups.  
- **Error Handling:** Retries with jitter, watchdogs for ANR/crashes, auto app relaunch, device reboot hooks, and Slack/Discord incident alerts.
